ER has been extensively studied by the database community with supervised machine learning approaches achieving the state-of-the-art results. However, supervised ML requires many labeled examples, both matches and unmatches, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we investigate an important problem: how can we design an unsupervised algorithm for ER that can achieve performance comparable to supervised approaches? We propose an automated ER solution, AutoER, that requires zero labeled examples. Our central insight is that the similarity vectors for matches should look different from that of unmatches. A number of innovations are needed to translate the intuition into an actual algorithm for ER. We advocate for the use of generative models to capture the two similarity vector distributions (the match distribution and the unmatch distribution). We propose an expectation maximization based algorithm to learn the model parameters. Our algorithm addresses many practical challenges including feature correlations, model overfitting, class imbalance, and transitivity between matches. On six datasets from four different domains, we show that the performance of AutoER is comparable and sometimes even better than supervised ML approaches.","tags":[],"title":"AutoER: Automated Entity Resolution using Generative Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renzhi Wu","Sergey Sukhanov","Christian Debes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1547697539,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579233907,"objectID":"42f4f42cae621f9b66baf4e2cf7eb6cc","permalink":"https://wurenzhi.github.io/publication/real_time_query/","publishdate":"2019-01-17T11:58:59+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/real_time_query/","section":"publication","summary":"Pattern matching in time series data streams is considered to be an essential data mining problem that still stays challenging for many practical scenarios. Different factors such as noise, varying amplitude scale or shift, signal stretches or shrinks in time are all leading to performance degradation of many existing pattern matching algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic z-normalization mechanism allowing for proper signal scaling even under significant time and amplitude distortions. Based on that, we further propose a Dynamic Time Warping-based real-time pattern matching method to recover hidden patterns that can be distorted in both time and amplitude. We evaluate our proposed method on synthetic and real-world scenarios under realistic conditions demonstrating its high operational characteristics comparing to other state-of-the-art pattern matching methods.","tags":[],"title":"Real-Time Pattern Matching with Dynamic Normalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sergey Sukhanov","Renzhi Wu","Christian Debes","Abdelhak M.

Dynamic and fast updating data streams are often subject to outliers, noise and potential distortions in amplitude and time dimensions. Such conditions typically lead to a failure of existing pattern matching algorithms and to inability to retrieve required patterns from the stream. The main reason for such failures is the limitation of data normalization utilized in the majority of methods. Another reason is the lack of means to consider multiple examples of the same template to account for possible variations of the query signal. In this paper, we propose a dynamic normalization approach that allows bringing streaming signal subsequences to the scale of the query template. This significantly improves pattern retrieval capabilities, especially when sampling variance or time distortions are present. We further develop a pattern matching approach utilizing the proposed normalization mechanism and extend it for the case when multiple examples of a query template are available. Multiple synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that this allows to considerably improve the pattern matching rate for distorted data streams, providing real time performance.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Pattern Matching with Multiple Queries on Large Scale Data Streams","type":"publication"}]
