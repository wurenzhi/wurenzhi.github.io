ER has been extensively studied by the database community with supervised machine learning approaches achieving the state-of-the-art results. However, supervised ML requires many labeled examples, both matches and unmatches, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we investigate an important problem: how can we design an unsupervised algorithm for ER that can achieve performance comparable to supervised approaches? We propose an automated ER solution, AutoER, that requires zero labeled examples. Our central insight is that the similarity vectors for matches should look different from that of unmatches. A number of innovations are needed to translate the intuition into an actual algorithm for ER. We advocate for the use of generative models to capture the two similarity vector distributions (the match distribution and the unmatch distribution). We propose an expectation maximization based algorithm to learn the model parameters. Our algorithm addresses many practical challenges including feature correlations, model overfitting, class imbalance, and transitivity between matches. On six datasets from four different domains, we show that the performance of AutoER is comparable and sometimes even better than supervised ML approaches.","tags":[],"title":"AutoER: Automated Entity Resolution using Generative Modelling","type":"publication"}]
